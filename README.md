# Formula-1-Win-Predictor

This project predicts the probability of a Formula 1 driver winning a race based on features like qualifying position, laps completed, constructor, and driver information. It uses XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) for predictions

# Project Workflow

Data Collection: Race data is fetched using the Ergast API.
Data Preprocessing: Data is cleaned and prepared for model training.
Model Training: An XGBoost Classifier is trained on race data to predict the winner's probability.
Model Evaluation: Model accuracy and feature importance are analyzed.
